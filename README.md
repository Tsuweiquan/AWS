# AWS
This repo contains some AWS script that was written during my internship. The scipts are using the boto3 python API from AWS which are quiet easily written. I might not have a good coding practice but I will try to write it to follow the S.O.L.I.D Principle. Data are stored into CSV upon extraction completion. 

- IAM Info Extractor!
The IAM Info Extractor will extract IAM Users, Groups and Permission Sets information for each user.
